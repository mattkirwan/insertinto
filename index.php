		<h2>Quick and dirty MySQL INSERT generator.</h2>
		<div id="content">
			<p>We've all wrote quick script's to generate SQL queries that allow us to insert bulk data in one fell swoop.</p>
			<p>I've hacked together this site to do just that. For now it's only really good at generating many to many schema's, the aim is to add more options over time.</p>
			<p>Ultimately this idea is nothing new, like many other quick snippets of code it was nearly lost forever - until I realised that the best domain name in the world was available.</p>
